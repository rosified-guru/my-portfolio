        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          I am an IT student with a growing interest in frontend development
          and UI/UX design. I enjoy building clean, responsive interfaces
          and learning how design and development work together to create
          meaningful user experiences.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          I am currently improving my skills with Next.js, TypeScript,
          and Tailwind CSS while actively seeking internship and junior
          frontend opportunities.
